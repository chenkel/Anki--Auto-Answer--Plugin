DISCONTINUED - Needs Anki 1.2.8 and won't work with current Anki 2.x series.

Anki 'Auto Answer' Plugin

Title: Auto Answer
Tags: timer automation countdown attention pressure

After 9 seconds the answer to the current card is automatically shown and the "again" button will be focused (so that you just have to press the space bar to repeat the card). 

You can configure the time span by opening the plugin file in a text editor and setting the value of secondsUntilAnswer to another amount of seconds (line 17 of the file).
